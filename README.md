# lolmatchstats
Data visualization for League of Legends match statistics.

Since I'm not very good at League of Legends, I like to look at the advanced match details when I finish a game. I found that I wanted to be able to zoom in on certain stats over time and easily switch between them, and found the official stats page lacking. This app is my attempt to make something that helps my own post-match analysis. If it is of interest to anyone else along the way, fantastic!
